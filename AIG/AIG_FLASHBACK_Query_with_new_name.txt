Flashback query to see data without performing flashback task. This will help PSS to validate data, I used this in one of MIM incident and issue got resolved.

select count(*) from employee  as of TIMESTAMP TO_TIMESTAMP('2025-05-19 12:34:00', 'YYYY-MM-DD HH:MI:SS');

Even, we can insert the data using flashback data which are needed. if records are already there in table, then it will fail with unique constraints error. To avoid, we can create a new table with same metadata and can insert data.

insert into employee_temp (select *from employee as of TIMESTAMP TO_TIMESTAMP('2025-05-19 12:34:00','YYYY-MM-DD HH:MI:SS'));

Flashback table before drop with new name,

FLASHBACK TABLE flash_test.employee to before drop RENAME TO NEW_EMP;

Flashback table to required timestamp,

ALTER TABLE flash_test.NEW_EMP ENABLE ROW MOVEMENT;

FLASHBACK TABLE flash_test.NEW_EMP to TIMESTAMP TO_TIMESTAMP('2025-05-19 15:34:00', 'YYYY-MM-DD HH24:MI:SS');

ALTER TABLE flash_test.NEW_EMP DISABLE ROW MOVEMENT;
